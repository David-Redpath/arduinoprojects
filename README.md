# arduinoprojects
My experiments, designs of Arduino code and systems.  Mostly measurement, data logging  and control

I use the Arduino 2560 rev 3.
Over the past number of years I've come across so many codes that are designed for the Arduino Uno 
which require slight modifications for use with the Arduino Mega any code that has been uploaded by me
has been tested on my own official Arduino Mega 2560 R3 
Good luck with your own experiments and comments feedback are welcomed.
